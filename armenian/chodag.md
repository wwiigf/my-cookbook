## Ingredients
- 5-6 cups flour
- 2 cubes butter (2 sticks/1 cup)

## Instructions
1. **Melt butter:** Warm butter on low flame until just melted and lukewarm.

2. **Mix wet ingredients:** Add sugar and beaten eggs to butter. Dissolve yeast cake in lukewarm milk and add to mixture.

3. **Add flour:** Add flour one cup at a time. May need 5-6 cups total. Don't make dough too stiff - should be soft but not sticky.

4. **First rise:** Cover dough and let rise 1 to 1.5 hours until doubled.

5. **Shape:** Punch down dough. Divide and braid on board dusted with sesame seeds. Place on greased cookie sheet.

6. **Second rise:** Let rise again in warm place until puffy, about 1 hour.

7. **Egg wash:** Brush with beaten egg.

8. **Bake:** Bake at 350°F until light golden brown, about 25-30 minutes.

## Notes
- The sesame seeds on the board stick to the bottom during shaping - that's the technique
- Don't rush the rises - that's what makes it light and fluffy
