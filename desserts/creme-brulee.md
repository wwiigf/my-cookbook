Ingredients

2 cups heavy cream
1 vanilla bean (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)
4 large egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar (plus extra for torching)


Instructions

Preheat oven: Set oven to 300Â°F.
Infuse cream: Place heavy cream in a small pot. Split vanilla bean, scrape seeds, and add both pod and seeds to cream. Bring to a slow simmer then immediately remove from heat. DO NOT LET IT BOIL.
Strain: Strain cream into a bowl to remove vanilla pod pieces.
Cool slightly: Let cream cool down for 10 minutes.
Make custard base: Whisk egg yolks and sugar until smooth and pale in color.
Temper eggs: Slowly add warm heavy cream to egg mixture, whisking continuously until fully combined. Go slow to avoid scrambling the eggs.
Strain again: Strain mixture one more time to ensure smoothness.
Fill ramekins: Divide custard mixture equally among ramekins. Remove any air bubbles by running a torch over the tops quickly, or tapping the ramekins lightly on the counter.
Prepare water bath: Place ramekins in a deep baking pan on the oven rack.
Add water: Fill pan with hot water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
Bake carefully: SLOWLY push oven rack in. Bake custards for 35 minutes until barely set. They should jiggle when gently shaken.
Initial cooling: Remove from oven and water bath. Let cool for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Chill: Loosely cover and chill in refrigerator for at least 4 hours. Overnight is best for optimal texture.
BrÃ»lÃ©e the sugar: When ready to serve, top each custard with 1 tsp of sugar. Use a kitchen torch to melt and caramelize the sugar until golden brown.
Final set: Let sugar harden for 1-2 minutes, then serve immediately.


Notes

The vanilla bean makes a huge difference but extract works in a pinch
The water bath (bain-marie) ensures gentle, even cooking
Don't overbake - a jiggly center will set perfectly as it chills
For the best crackly top, make sure custards are cold and use superfine sugar
The torch is what makes this special - everyone loves the theater of it
You can make these up to 2 days ahead, just torch right before serving
The satisfying crack when you tap the caramelized sugar is half the fun
