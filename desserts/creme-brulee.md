> *"Everyone gets stoked when the hand torch comes out"*

**Prep Time:** 20 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 35 minutes  
**Chill Time:** 4+ hours (overnight best)  
**Total Time:** 5+ hours  
**Servings:** 4-6 ramekins

## Ingredients

- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 vanilla bean (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)
- 4 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup sugar (plus extra for torching)

---

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven:** Set oven to 300°F.

2. **Infuse cream:** Place heavy cream in a small pot. Split vanilla bean, scrape seeds, and add both pod and seeds to cream. Bring to a slow simmer then immediately remove from heat. **DO NOT LET IT BOIL.**

3. **Strain:** Strain cream into a bowl to remove vanilla pod pieces.

4. **Cool slightly:** Let cream cool down for 10 minutes.

5. **Make custard base:** Whisk egg yolks and sugar until smooth and pale in color.

6. **Temper eggs:** Slowly add warm heavy cream to egg mixture, whisking continuously until fully combined. Go slow to avoid scrambling the eggs.

7. **Strain again:** Strain mixture one more time to ensure smoothness.

8. **Fill ramekins:** Divide custard mixture equally among ramekins. Remove any air bubbles by running a torch over the tops quickly, or tapping the ramekins lightly on the counter.

9. **Prepare water bath:** Place ramekins in a deep baking pan on the oven rack.

10. **Add water:** Fill pan with hot water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.

11. **Bake carefully:** SLOWLY push oven rack in. Bake custards for 35 minutes until barely set. They should jiggle when gently shaken.

12. **Initial cooling:** Remove from oven and water bath. Let cool for 30 minutes at room temperature.

13. **Chill:** Loosely cover and chill in refrigerator for at least 4 hours. Overnight is best for optimal texture.

14. **Brûlée the sugar:** When ready to serve, top each custard with 1 tsp of sugar. Use a kitchen torch to melt and caramelize the sugar until golden brown.

15. **Final set:** Let sugar harden for 1-2 minutes, then serve immediately.

## Notes

- The vanilla bean makes a huge difference but extract works in a pinch
- Don't overbake - a jiggly center will set perfectly as it chills
- For the best crackly top, make sure custards are cold and use superfine sugar
- You can make these up to 2 days ahead, just torch right before serving
- For bigger remmikens, you'll need to bake longer. Just check every 5 min to ensure you're not overcooking.
