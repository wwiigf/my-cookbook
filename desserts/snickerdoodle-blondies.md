## Instructions

1. **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line an 8×8-inch pan with parchment paper, leaving overhang for easy removal. Mix cinnamon-sugar filling in a small bowl and set aside.

2. **Cream wet ingredients:** In a large bowl, cream melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy (2–3 minutes). Beat in eggs one at a time, then vanilla.

3. **Mix dry ingredients:** In separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch, cream of tartar, and salt. Gradually fold into wet ingredients until just combined. Don't overmix.

4. **Layer:** Spread half the batter in prepared pan. Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar filling evenly over batter. Drop spoonfuls of remaining batter on top and carefully smooth with offset spatula. Sprinkle top with extra cinnamon-sugar.

5. **Bake:** Bake 30-35 minutes until edges are golden and toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs. These are thick, so may need an extra minute or two.

6. **Cool and cut:** Cool completely in pan on wire rack. Lift out using parchment and cut into squares.

## Notes
- Don't overmix - overmixing turns into into a cake, not a chewy oowey gooey
- Don't overbake - slightly underdone is better than dry
