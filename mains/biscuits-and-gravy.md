## Instructions

1. **Cook the meats:** Brown sausage and bacon in a large pan over medium-high heat until fully cooked and crispy. Remove meats and set aside, keeping all the grease in the pan.

2. **Check your grease:** Ensure you have at least 3 tablespoons of grease in the pan. If not, add butter to make up the difference.

3. **Bloom the spices:** Add chili flakes and caraway seeds to the hot grease. Brown for 1-2 minutes to release their flavors.

4. **Make the roux:** Add flour to the seasoned grease, stirring constantly. Cook the roux for 2-3 minutes until it's golden and smells nutty.

5. **Add milk gradually:** Whisk in warm milk one cup at a time, fully incorporating each addition before adding the next. This prevents lumps.

6. **Thicken the gravy:** Bring just to a boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer. Let it bubble gently until it reaches your desired thickness (about 5-10 minutes).

7. **Return the meats:** Chop or crumble the cooked sausage and bacon, then stir back into the gravy.

8. **Season:** Taste and adjust with additional salt and pepper as needed.

9. **Serve:** Ladle generously over split butter biscuits. Serve with hot sauce on the side.

## Notes

- The gravy will continue to thicken as it cools, so keep it slightly thinner than your target
- Make sure your biscuits are fresh and warm for maximum satisfaction
