## Instructions
1. **Prep sauce:** Make sure you have [Every Day Tomato Sauce](../sauces-rubs/every-day-tomato-sauce.md) ready to go.

2. **Butterfly chicken:** Butterfly breasts and pound thin. Don't over-pound or tear them.

3. **Dry brine:** Sprinkle with salt, refrigerate 1-2 hours.

4. **Breading station:** Set up flour → eggs → breadcrumb mixture, plus a sheet pan for finished cutlets.

5. **Heat oil:** Fill pan with enough vegetable oil to submerge cutlets. Heat to 350°F.

6. **Bread cutlets:** Coat in flour, dredge in eggs, coat in breadcrumb/panko/corn flake mixture. Shake off excess. Place on sheet pan.

7. **Fry:** Fry each cutlet separately at 350°F. Flip after 3-5 minutes. Remove when golden brown.

8. **Drain:** Pat cutlets with paper towel, sprinkle with salt while hot.

9. **Prep broiler:** Heat up oven broiler.

10. **Assemble:** Place cutlet on oven-safe pan (stainless steel works great).

11. **Top:** Add tomato sauce, fresh grated parmesan, then mozzarella slices (this order matters). Drizzle olive oil on top.

12. **Broil:** Place under broiler until mozzarella is melted, bubbling, and starting to char.

13. **Serve:** Slide onto plate and serve immediately while you finish remaining cutlets.

## Notes
- Fresh mozzarella is non-negotiable - pre-shredded won't give you those beautiful cheese pulls
- The corn flakes add incredible crunch
- Serving one at a time keeps them hot and crispy - your guests will appreciate it
- Don't skip the dry brine - it seasons the meat all the way through
- The order of toppings matters: sauce protects the crust, cheese on top gets the char
