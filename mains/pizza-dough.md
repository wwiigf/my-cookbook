## Ingredients

### 70% Hydration Dough
- 295g bread flour
- 210g warm water
- 5g diastatic malt powder
- 10g salt
- 6g yeast
- 6g honey
- Splash of olive oil

---

## Instructions
1. Mix your flour, malt powder, and salt in your stand mixing bowl
2. In a separate container (I use a pyrex 2cup measuring cup), mix your warm water with the honey and yeast. Stir to combine. Let this sit for up to 5 min, or until the yeast is bubbling
3. Turn on your stand mixer with the dough hook attached
4. Add water/yeast mixture to the flour mixture
5. Add in a splash of olive oil
6. Mix until smooth. Around 5-6 min. The dough ball should still be sticking to the bottom of the bowl, but not to the sides
7. Cover with a damp towel for 10 min
8. Remove the damp towel, and stretch and fold the dough. Remove the dough from the standmixing bowl, and transfer to a large bowl sprayed with Pam
9. Let the dough rest for 1 hour
10. Remove dough, and shape in a pizza ball. Either one ball, or two smaller balls. Transfer back to the greased bowl to rest for an additional 30 min.
11. Remove dough, and shape in a pizza ball AGAIN. Transfer back to the greased bowl to rest for an additional 30 min.
12. Heat up pizza oven for cooking (30 min to heat up).
13. Shape the pizza, top, cook, enjoy.

## Sourdough Pizza Variation

**Additional Prep:** 1 hour for levain  
**Servings:** 1 Large pizza

### Ingredients
- 150g Levain (50g starter, 50g bread flour, 50g water - mixed and rested 1 hour)
- 220g bread flour
- 5g diastatic malt powder
- 5g salt
- 5g yeast
- 145g water

### Instructions
1. **Make levain:** Mix 50g starter, 50g bread flour, and 50g water. Let rest 1 hour until bubbly.
2. Follow the exact same recipe as above, but add the levain to your dry ingredients before adding the water/yeast mixture in step 4.
3. Continue with remaining steps exactly as written.

### Sourdough Notes
- The levain adds tang and complexity to the flavor
- Still using commercial yeast for reliability - the starter is for flavor
- This hybrid approach gives sourdough taste without the 24-hour wait

## Notes
- Shaping the ball twice before cooking allows the dough to rise more
- Substitute 210g of water for 160g beer + 50g water for more significant malt flavor
- Only use bread flour. The 00 flour is a scam and does not hydrate consistently
- For cheese: 50/50 blend of part skim, and whole milk mozz, plus a good cheddar. Add fresh parm when done cooking.
- For shaping tips, do method 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8VQUAx0WFU&t=163s
