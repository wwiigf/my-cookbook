## Instructions

1. **Trim the pork:** Trim excess fat from your pork butt, leaving about 1/4 inch fat cap.

2. **Apply rub and brine:** Generously coat the pork with pork rub, getting into all crevices. Place in fridge for a 6-hour dry brine.

3. **Prepare the BGE:** Set up Big Green Egg for long term fire (refer to [the wiseone PDF](../resources/wiseone.pdf) for detailed instructions). Target dome temp: 225-240¬∞F.

4. **Start the smoke:** Put pork on BGE at 10pm (for a 3pm lunch next day) with dome temp stabilized at 225-240¬∞F.

5. **Pour a drink:** This is important. Pour yourself a bourbon and wait until morning.

6. **Morning check:** Check dome temp in the morning, adjust fire as needed to maintain 225-240¬∞F.

7. **Cook to temp:** Continue cooking until pork reaches 200¬∞F internal temperature (usually 12-14 hours total).

8. **Rest and sauce:** Remove pork and immediately douse with vinegar finishing sauce. Wrap tightly in foil and let rest until serving (minimum 1 hour).

9. **Pull and serve:** When ready to serve, shred pork coarsely. Season with salt and additional finishing sauce to taste.

10. **Serve:** Pile high on buns or serve alongside cornbread with all your favorite fixins'.

## Notes

- The overnight cook is the way to go - start at 10pm for lunch the next day
- Don't rush the process - low and slow is the key to perfect pulled pork
- The bourbon isn't just for drinking (though that's important) - it helps pass the time
- The vinegar sauce before wrapping is crucial for flavor penetration
- Internal temp of 200¬∞F ensures the connective tissue has fully broken down
