## Instructions

1. **Cook the macaroni:** Partially cook macaroni in seasoning water (chicken bouillon and salt). Drain, transfer to a bowl, and add a tab of butter to the macaroni. Mix until the melted butter coats the macaroni noodles.

2. **Make the roux:** In a saucepan, melt 1 stick of butter. Add flour and whisk. Slowly add milk, whisking continuously until silken. 
   > **Note:** You can substitute milk for evaporated milk for a more classic macaroni texture

3. **Add Velveeta:** Add 1/5 block of Velveeta to the roux. Cut up Velveeta into small pieces so it melts easier. Stir until completely melted.

4. **Season the sauce:** Add all seasonings to mixture (mustards, hot sauce, and all dry seasonings).

5. **Add main cheeses:** Add 1/3 block each of Monterey Jack, Cheddar, and Colby Jack to the seasoned mixture. Mix until melted.

6. **Combine:** Add the cheese mixture to the macaroni (in a large bowl). Stir to combine. Add 1/4â€“1/2 cup milk to the mixture to help thin out the sauce. It shouldn't be too difficult to stir, and should be more liquidy. Add more seasonings as necessary.

7. **First bake:** Add entire mixture to a buttered dish. Bake at 350Â°F for 15 minutes uncovered.

8. **Add toppings:** Remove dish from the oven, and top with shredded cheeses and cubes of butter. 
   > **IMPORTANT:** This will be 1/4 cup of butter, cut into small cubes and evenly placed over the top of the dish.

9. **Final bake:** Bake an additional 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and golden.

- Don't skip the mustards - they add a tangy depth that balances all that cheese
