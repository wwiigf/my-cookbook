## Instructions

This recipe builds on the [Every Day Tomato Sauce](../sauces-rubs/every-day-tomato-sauce.md). 

### Make the Vodka Sauce
1. Follow the [Every Day Tomato Sauce](../sauces-rubs/every-day-tomato-sauce.md) recipe through step 2.

2. **Add vodka:** After extracting garlic flavor, add 2 Tbsp vodka and cook it down.

3. Continue with remaining tomato sauce steps (3-5).

4. **Make it vodka sauce:** Add heavy cream until sauce turns orange/pinkish. Stir to combine.

### Finish the Dish
5. **Cook pasta:** Boil bow tie noodles al dente. Reserve pasta water before draining.

6. **Marry pasta and sauce:** In a separate pan, add vodka sauce, splash of pasta water, and small cube of butter. Stir to combine. I use my normal stainless steel pan to combine. 

7. **Combine:** Add bow ties, toss thoroughly to coat with vodka sauce.

8. **Serve:** Top with fresh cracked pepper and parmesan (the good stuff please).

## Notes
- Don't skip the pasta water, and butter in the combine step - the starch helps the sauce stick
- Fresh parmesan makes all the difference - pre-grated is for idiots
