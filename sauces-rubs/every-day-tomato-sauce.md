> *"Your base for every italian recipe needing a tomato sauce"*

**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 1 hour 20 minutes  
**Total Time:** 1.5 hours  
**Yield:** Enough for 2-3 meals

## Ingredients
- 3-4 glugs of olive oil
- 6 cloves of garlic, sliced
- 1 Tbsp red pepper flakes
- 3 basil leaves
- 2 cans crushed tomatoes
- Salt and pepper to taste
- OPTIONAL: chopped calabrian chilis

---

## Instructions
1. **Coat pot:** Add olive oil to sauce pot - just enough to coat the bottom.

2. **Extract flavor:** Add sliced garlic, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt to the pan. Turn on LOW heat. Extract flavor from garlic and chilis without browning or burning. 8-10 minutes.

3. **Amplify tomato:** Add a splash of crushed tomatoes to the oil/garlic/chili mixture. Mix and cook 8-10 minutes until fragrant. This creates pseudo tomato paste.

4. **Add remaining tomatoes:** Add rest of canned tomatoes. Stir and bring to mild simmer (bubbles popping).

5. **Long simmer:** Reduce heat, partially cover pot, and cook for 1 hour. Stir periodically to prevent burning on bottom.

## Notes
- This is your workhorse sauce - spaghetti, chicken parm, vodka past, sausage and peppers
- Low and slow on the garlic - burnt garlic ruins everything
- Calabrian chilis take this from good to restaurant-level. Add them in alongside the garlic to extract maximum flavor.
