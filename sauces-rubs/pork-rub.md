## Notes

- The kosher salt note is serious - iodized salt will give an off, metallic flavor
- Hawaiian raw sugar adds a subtle molasses note if you can find it
- Pure chili powder means just ground chiles - check the label
- Hungarian paprika has more depth than regular paprika
- The sage is what sets this apart from typical BBQ rubs - don't skip it
- This rub is perfectly balanced for low and slow cooking
