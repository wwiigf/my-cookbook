## Ingredients

### Aromatics & Meat
- 1 medium yellow onion (about 8 oz / 225 g), diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 strips bacon
- 1 smoked ham hock

### Seasonings
- 1 teaspoon (4 g) smoked paprika
- 1 tsp cajun seasoning
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp coarse seasoning

## Instructions

1. **Cook the bacon:** In a large pot over medium heat, cook the bacon strips until crispy. Remove bacon and set aside, leaving the grease in the pot.

2. **Sweat aromatics:** Add the diced onions and minced garlic to the bacon grease. Sweat until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes.

3. **Build the base:** Add chicken stock, all seasonings, a splash of apple cider vinegar, and the smoked ham hock to the pot.

4. **First simmer:** Bring to a simmer and let the ham hock flavor the broth for about 10 minutes.

5. **Add greens:** Add all the collard greens to the pot. They'll seem like a lot at first but will cook down significantly.

6. **Second simmer:** Bring back to a simmer.

7. **Cook uncovered:** Cook uncovered for 30 minutes until greens are tender but not mushy.

8. **Final seasoning:** Taste and season additionally as needed with salt, pepper, and vinegar.

9. **Serve:** Crumble the reserved bacon on top before serving. Include some of the flavorful pot liquor with each serving.

## Notes

- The title says it all - seasoning is EVERYTHING with collard greens
- Clean the greens thoroughly before cooking - they can be sandy
- The ham hock is non-negotiable for authentic flavor
- Don't skip the vinegar - it brightens the whole dish
- The "pot liquor" (cooking liquid) is gold - serve it with the greens
- These reheat beautifully and are even better the next day
