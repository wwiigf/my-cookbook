## Instructions

1. **Preheat with cast iron:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Put your cast iron skillet in the oven as it preheats.

2. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a bowl, combine flour, yellow cornmeal, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.

3. **Melt butter:** Melt the stick of butter and let it cool slightly.

4. **Combine wet ingredients:** In a separate bowl, add oil, sugar, honey, and melted butter. Mix well. Wait for melted butter to cool before proceeding.

5. **Add eggs and buttermilk:** Once butter mixture has cooled, add eggs and buttermilk. Whisk until fully incorporated.

6. **Combine wet and dry:** Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients using a spoon (not the whisk). Don't over mix - some lumps are fine.

7. **Prepare the pan:** Carefully remove the hot cast iron pan from the oven and completely butter it.

8. **Bake:** Add mixture to the hot, buttered pan. Place cast iron in the oven and bake at 375°F for 30 minutes.

9. **Cool and serve:** Remove from oven, let cool for 10 minutes, and serve with butter and honey.

## Notes

- Preheating the cast iron creates an amazing crispy crust
- Don't overmix - this leads to tough, dense cornbread
