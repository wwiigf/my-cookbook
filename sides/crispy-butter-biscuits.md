## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup (170 grams) cold unsalted butter
- 3⅓ cups (425 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
- 1 tablespoon baking powder

- Flaky sea salt

## Instructions

1. **Prep the butter:** Using a microplane or box grater, shred your cold unsalted butter. Place immediately in the freezer while you assemble the dry ingredients.

2. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.

3. **Add frozen butter:** Remove shredded butter from freezer and add to dry ingredients. Toss gently to coat butter shreds with flour.

4. **Add buttermilk:** Add cold buttermilk in batches, mixing gently with a spoon between additions. The dough should just come together - don't overmix.

5. **Shape and fold:** Remove dough from bowl and shape into a rectangle on a floured surface. Fold the dough in on itself 5-6 times. This creates layers and makes the dough smooth.

6. **Cut biscuits:** Pat dough to about 1-inch thickness. Cut into even squares or use a round cutter for traditional biscuits.

7. **Optional egg wash:** If using, brush tops with beaten egg and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.

8. **Bake:** Place biscuits on a baking sheet. Bake in a 375°F oven for 35 minutes until golden brown and crispy on top.

9. **Serve:** Best served warm with butter, honey, gravy, or jam.

## Notes

- Shredding and freezing the butter is the secret to incredible flaky layers
- The folding technique (lamination) creates distinct layers like a croissant
- Don't twist the cutter when making round biscuits - it seals the edges and prevents rising
